      <h3>Let's learn MULTIPLICATION</h3>
      <p> Multiplication is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic, with the other ones being addition, subtraction and division. The result of a multiplication operation is called a product.
        </br>Example:</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book costs $ 67. How much will be paid for 103 such books?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOLUTION: 102 books x $67 = $6901 in total <br></p>
